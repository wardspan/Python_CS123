# Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room numbers 
# of the rooms where the courses meet. The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:
# Course Number (key) CS101 CS102 CS103 NT110 CM241
# Room Number (value) 3004  4501  6755  1244  1411
#
# The program should also create a dictionary containing the instructors that teach each course. 
# The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:
# Course Number (key) CS101 CS102 CS103 NT110 CM241
# Instructor (value) Haynes Alvarado Rich Burke Lee
#
# The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the meeting times of each course. 
# The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:
# Course Number (key) CS101 CS102 CS103 NT110 CM241
# Meeting Time (value) 8:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. 10:00 a.m. 11:00 a.m. 1:00 p.m.
#
# The program should let the user enter a course number, then it should display the courseâ€™s room number, 
# instructor, and meeting time.
