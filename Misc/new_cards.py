# Write a program which simulates the game of cards. The game that you create has two players and each one picks two cards.  
# The players are awarded points for the cards using the rules given below. Calculate total points for each player and at 
# the end print the cards rank and suit number for each player. Compare the total points of two players and announce the winner, 
# the player with higher points. The points for a card equal the rank of the card unless itâ€™s an Ace. For face cards the 
# points are ace 20, king 13, queen 12 and the jack has 11 points. The additional points are awarded as: 
# 1.	Two cards of same rank 100 points.
# 2.	Two cards in a sequence and same suit 70 points.
# 3.	Two cards in a sequence but different suit 50 points.
