"""
Write a program which simulates the game of cards.
The game that you create has two players and each one picks two cards.
The players are awarded points for the cards using the rules given below.
Calculate total points for each player and at the end print the cards rank and suit number for each player.
Compare the total points of two players and announce the winner, the player with higher points.
The points for a card equal the rank of the card unless itâ€™s an Ace.
For face cards the points are ace 20, king 13, queen 12 and the jack has 11 points.
The additional points are awarded as:
1. Two cards of same rank 100 points.
2. Two cards in a sequence and same suit 70 points.
3. Two cards in a sequence but different suit 50 points.
